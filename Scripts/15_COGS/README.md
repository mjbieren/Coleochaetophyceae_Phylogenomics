# 15. Combine Orthogroup Sets

**COGS (Combine OrthoGroup Sets)** is a custom tool designed to merge two orthogroup datasets in a phylogenomic workflow. In our study on Klebsormidiophyceae, we encountered a situation where two orthogroup inference runs gave complementary results:

- The **Outgroup Set** included better representation for **outgroup taxa**, but had poor ingroup coverage.
- The **Ingroup Set** offered strong **ingroup coverage**, but missed several key outgroup sequences.

Rather than rerunning the entire pipeline from the OSG step, we used **Method 2** of COGS to merge these two sets in a fast and resource-efficient manner. This method reuses the multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and gene trees already generated by MIAF, avoiding the need to recompute them.

## Why We Used COGS (Method 2)

- **Orthogroup names** were parsed from the PhyloPyPruner output folders of both sets.
- **Duplicates** were automatically removed.
- The tool then referenced the original PhyloPyPruner input folders to **copy the relevant MSA and tree files** into a new, combined folder.

This provided us with a unified and taxonomically balanced orthogroup dataset â€” ready for downstream analyses â€” without requiring additional alignment or gene tree steps.

This approach significantly **reduced computational time and memory usage**, while improving dataset completeness.

### Method 2
```
COGS_Static.out -s <PPP_INGROUP_OUTPUT> -x <PPP_INGROUP_INPUT> -t <FPPP_OUTGROUP_OUTPUT> -y <PPP_OUTGROUP_INPUT> [-p]
```
