# Phylopypruner on the combined set
After combining the two sets we obtained a combined set (without duplicates) of orthogroups where the paralogs aren't removed or "pruned" yet.
Therefor we have to rerun [Phylopypruner](https://github.com/fethalen/phylopypruner) made by Dr. Felicia Sandberg

We use the setting:

```
ds
```
