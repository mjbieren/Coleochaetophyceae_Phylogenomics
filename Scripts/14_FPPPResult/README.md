# 14. Filter PhyloPyprunerResult (FilterPPPResult)

[FilterPPPresult](https://github.com/mjbieren/FilterPPPResult/tree/main) processes the output FASTA alignment files generated by Phylopypruner, applying a filter based on a user-specified taxonomic group threshold. It evaluates each FASTA file to determine if it contains sequences from at least the minimum required number of distinct taxonomic groups. Files failing to meet this threshold are excluded, while qualifying files are copied to the designated output folder.

Additionally, the tool offers options to clean up sequence headers by removing gene IDs and retaining only strain or species names, as well as to remove alignment gaps (represented by '-') from sequences. This gap removal is particularly useful for downstream steps, such as realignment with other methods.

The program is designed for efficiency: it runs on a single CPU, works on any 64-bit machine, and is optimized such that approximately 5% of the runtime is spent parsing input files, while 95% is spent writing output files—a process influenced heavily by disk or network speeds. Output files are limited to under 1 GB of RAM usage to ensure stability.

Users can generate a summary file that details the number of input FASTA files, the total taxonomic groups considered, the threshold applied, and the number of files filtered or retained. This provides a clear overview of the filtering process and its impact on the dataset.


## Taxonomic Group Files & Thresholds
For both sets, we used a threshold of 10 out of 28.
