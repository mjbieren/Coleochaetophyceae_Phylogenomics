# Step 10: OrthoGroup Sequence Grabber (OSG)

**OSG** is a custom C++ tool developed to filter orthogroups based on user-defined taxonomic groupings. These groupings allow you to emphasize either an ingroup (e.g., your focal lineage) or outgroup, depending on your downstream needs.

By intentionally creating "biased" datasets focused on either the ingroup or outgroup, and then combining them in a later step (e.g., COGS), you can achieve a well-balanced gene set that improves phylogenomic resolution across your entire dataset.

## 🔍 Purpose in This Pipeline

For the **Coleochaetophyceae** dataset, we generated two filtered orthogroup sets:

- **Ingroup-biased set** – favors Coleochaetophyceae coverage
- **Outgroup-biased set** – favors outgroup taxon representation

These complementary sets are later merged to provide a strong phylogenetic signal across both ingroup and outgroup lineages.

## 🌐 Dataset Details

### 🔹 Outgroup Set

The dataset that favors the outgroups of the dataset

- **Taxonomic group file:**  
  [`Coleocheatephyceae_TaxonomicGroupFile_Outgroup_set.txt`](https://github.com/mjbieren/Coleochaetophyceae_Phylogenomics/blob/main/Scripts/10_OSG/TaxonomicGroupFiles/Coleocheatephyceae_TaxonomicGroupFile_Outgroup_set.txt)

- **Threshold:**  
  Minimum of 10 out of 14 taxonomic groups required per orthogroup.


### 🔹 Ingroup Set

The dataset that favors the ingroup of the dataset (Aka the Coleochaetophyceae species)

- **Taxonomic group file:**  
  [`Coleocheatephyceae_TaxonomicGroupFile_Ingroup_Set.txt`](https://github.com/mjbieren/Coleochaetophyceae_Phylogenomics/blob/main/Scripts/10_OSG/TaxonomicGroupFiles/Coleocheatephyceae_TaxonomicGroupFile_Ingroup_Set.txt)

- **Threshold:**  
  Minimum of 2 out of 4 taxonomic groups required per orthogroup.


### 🚀 Running the Tool

You can execute the OSG program with a command like:

```
OSG.out -g [ORTHOGROUP_DIR] -f [FASTA_DIR] -g [TaxonomicGroupFile.txt] -t [THRESHOLD] -r [OUTPUT_DIR]
```
